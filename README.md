# user.js-tweaker for Android/Fiefox Browsers

This will be the official [user.js](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js) by [pyllyukko](https://github.com/pyllyukko) and is maintained by [CHEF-KOCH](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH) and community. 


# Project Goals

* Merge all user.js settings into an addon
* Create profiles for different security levels (strong, medium, low)
* Add per-site (whitelist) support
* Check/remove internal Firefox certificates which aren't needed in 99% of all time to lower attacks
* ....
* 


# What it can't fix

* Chrome support (I will not add)
* Firefox security related issue which needs to be fixed within Firefox source code
* Already infected installations which are faked or bundled/manipulated with OpenCandy or trojans 
* Is not an alternative to Tor Firefox
